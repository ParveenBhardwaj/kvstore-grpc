```

## 1. proto/
- Location for all your .proto files
- Treated as the source of truth for your APIs
- Example: `proto/kvstore.proto`
You don't import from this package directly in Go - you generate code from it using `protoc` and import the generated code to implement and use.

## 2. gen/kvstorepb/ (or pb/)
- Contains code generated by `protoc`
  - Message structs (e.g. `SetRequest`, `GetResponse`)
  - gRPC server/client interfaces (e.g. `KVStoreServer`, `KVStoreClient`)
Used by both server and client. You typically treat this as read-only. This code changes when generated from an updated `.proto` file.

## 3. server/
- Implements the `KVStoreServer` interface from the generated go code above
- Contains logic to **start the gRPC server**, listen and serve
- Handles request validation and invokes business logic.

Example file: `server/kvstore.go`
```go
type KVServer struct {
    store store.Store
}
func (s *KVServer) Set(...) {...}
```

## client/ (optional)
- If your app includes a Go-based gRPC client
- Uses `kvstorepb.NewKVStoreClinet(conn)` to make RPC calls.
- Helpful for CLI tools or internal services.

Example: `client/cli.go`

## 5. store/
- Contains your core business logic and data layer
- Could be an in-memory map, a BoltDB/Redis/Postgres backend
- Keeps business logic separate from the transport logic.

Example file: `store/memory.go`, `store/postgres.go`
```go
type Store interface {
    Set(key, value string) error
    Get(keyh string) (string, error)
    Delete(key string) error
}
```

## 6. api/ (optional abstraction layer)
- Optional layer between `server/` and `store/`
- Helps you decouple the RPC layuer from the business logic
- Userful if you want to expose both gRPC and REST, etc.

## 7. cmd/
- Entry points for running your app (i.e. `main.go`)
- Could have subcommands like:
  - `cmd/server/main.go`
  - `cmd/client/main.go`

Keeps your `main.go` logic clean and separate from implementation. 

## 8. config/
- Handles reading config from files/env/flags
- Define a `Config` struct and parsing helpers here.

## 9. internal/
- Shared internal helpers (e.g. logging, metrics, middleware)
- Use `internal/` for things you don't want to be imported by external code.

## 10. test/ (optional)
- Integration test helpers, mock servers, testdata
- keeps test-specific logic isolated.
